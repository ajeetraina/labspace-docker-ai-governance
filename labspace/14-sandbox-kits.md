*A kit packages a reproducible sandbox declaratively — but it's developer-side convenience under the org ceiling: a kit can make an approved setup reproducible, it can't grant access the CISO's policy denies.*

The last three sections were the **admin's** view: network, filesystem, and MCP policies authored in Docker Hub and enforced on every sandbox in `$$org$$`. This section is the **developer's** view - how you package a sandbox that's reproducible and compliant *by construction*, instead of a pile of `sbx run` flags and a setup doc.

The answer is a **kit**: a declarative artifact - a `spec.yaml` plus an optional `files/` directory - that bundles everything a sandbox needs: tools to install, files to inject, network rules, credential wiring, and the agent itself. This is the governance-level overview; the sections that follow build kits hands-on.

**Time:** ~4 minutes (overview)
**Prerequisites:** Sections 03, 04, and 06.

## Why kits matter for governance

You already met every property a kit packages - kits just make them **declarative, composable, and shareable**:

| Property | You saw it in | A kit makes it... |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Egress allowlist | Network (03) | a few lines of `caps.network.allow` in `spec.yaml` |
| Credentials never enter the VM | Credential Isolation (12) | a `credentials` block with `apiKey.inject`, wired once |
| One governed MCP endpoint | MCP (06) | servers declared in the kit, attached at creation |
| Reproducible workspace | Filesystem (04) | static `files/` injected into the workspace |

Instead of "clone this, export that, remember `--kit` twice," a teammate runs **one command** and gets your exact, governed setup.

## Two kinds of kits

**Mixin kits** (`kind: mixin`) extend an existing agent - add a tool, drop in config, grant a new service. Stack several with multiple `--kit` flags.

**Agent kits** (`kind: sandbox` in kit-spec v2) define a full agent from scratch - image, entrypoint, network, credentials. The built-in `claude` you've been using is itself an agent kit; you can fork it and change one thing.

## What a kit can declare

| Field | What it does |
| --- | --- |
| `caps.network.allow` | Domains the sandbox may reach |
| `credentials` (list) | Per-service secrets the proxy injects via `apiKey.inject` - never in the VM |
| `files/` | Static files injected into the workspace or `/home/agent/` |
| `commands.install` | Runs once at creation - installs tools |
| `commands.startup` | Runs on every start - background services |

## What a kit looks like

A kit can be as small as a `spec.yaml` plus one file - here, a mixin that ships a Claude Code skill into the workspace:

```yaml
# kits/docker-review/spec.yaml
schemaVersion: "2"
kind: mixin
name: docker-review
displayName: Dockerfile review skill
description: Ships a Claude Code skill that reviews Dockerfiles
```

A teammate runs it - stacked on the built-in agent - with a single flag:

```bash no-run-button
sbx run claude --kit ./kits/docker-review/
```

Real deployments **layer** several mixins - a security baseline, a language toolchain, an org-config kit - and stack them with repeated `--kit` flags: `caps.network.allow` lists are unioned and every `files/` tree is injected. You build all of this hands-on in the sections that follow.

## The governance ceiling: kits don't widen policy

This is the point that ties kits back to the last three sections. A kit's `caps.network.allow` entries are **additive on top of what's already allowed** - but when `$$org$$` owns a rule type, **org policy is the ceiling**. A domain your kit lists that the org policy doesn't allow stays **blocked** (default-deny; local rules go inactive because *corporate policy takes precedence* - Section 02).

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Kits are developer-side convenience; **org governance is authoritative.** A kit can make an *approved* setup reproducible - it cannot grant an agent access the CISO's policy denies. Network, filesystem, and MCP policy all still win. That's the whole point: developers move fast *inside* the guardrails.

## How kits map to the three pillars

| Pillar | Enforced by (admin) | Packaged by (kit) |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Network | Org network policy | `caps.network.allow` (within the org ceiling) |
| Credential | Proxy injection | `credentials` block with `apiKey.inject` |
| MCP | Cedar allow-list at the gateway | servers declared / attached by the kit |
| Filesystem | Org filesystem policy | `files/` workspace injection (within allowed paths) |

## Where this goes next

The sections that follow are the hands-on kit-authoring track:

- **Kits: Introduction** - the two kinds of kits and the full capability surface
- **Kits: Your First Mixin** - build the `docker-review` skill kit end to end
- **Kits: Network & Credentials** - egress rules and proxy-managed credential injection
- **Kits: Fork an Agent Kit** - fork `claude` to require approval on every tool call
- **Kits: Stacking & Distribution** - stack kits and share via Git URL or OCI registry
- **Kits: Summary** - what kits give you that shell scripts don't

With policies enforced by the org and kits packaging compliant setups for developers, you've seen both sides of the model. Build your first kit next.
